# Najs Eloquent

If you are Laravel Eloquent lover and want to use it in Node JS you will love Najs Eloquent. Najs Eloquent is Laravel Eloquent, written in Typescript (with some helpers you can use it with Javascript for sure).

Current version (0.3.0) is targeted to Mongodb only (using Mongoose as ORM). Because MongoDB is not RDB then some features of Laravel Eloquent are cut off such as relationship, scope. In the way to 1.0.0 the Najs Eloquent will support full Eloquent feature with difference db like mysql, postgredb or sqllite (use knex as query builder).
